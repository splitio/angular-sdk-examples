# Angular JS SDK examples

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.1.

The goal of this project is to show one way to set up the Split SDK in Angular.

## Getting started
_Optional:_ If `nvm` is locally installed, run `nvm i` to set the required Node version. 
- `npm install`
- `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- `ng serve` will start a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
